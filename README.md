Our final model was a deep neural network, which achieved an AUC score of 0.932. The ROC curve for this model (Figure 1) shows good performance across different genres. The visualization of the lower-dimensional space (Figure 2) illustrates clear clusters, indicating that our dimensionality reduction strategy was effective. However, the challenge of accurately classifying 'Alternative' genre songs suggests further improvements could be made, potentially through additional feature engineering or the collection of more representative data for this genre. The most important factor underlying the success of our genre classification model was the careful handling of the dataset's features and the selection of an appropriate classification model. By addressing missing values with the KNN imputer and one-hot encoding the 'mode' variable, we ensured that the model had clean, well-structured data to learn from.

We initially attempted to use dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to simplify the dataset and potentially improve the model's performance. However, these techniques did not lead to well-separated clusters, and the models trained on the dimensionality-reduced data performed worse, in terms of AUC score, compared to models trained on the full dataset. This suggests that the full set of features was important for accurate classification in our case. 
The choice of using a deep neural network with a sigmoid activation function also played a significant role. This model structure was capable of handling the complexity and high dimensionality of our data, while the sigmoid activation function provided a faster convergence compared to other functions like ReLU in this particular dataset.
Furthermore, rigorous evaluation and comparison of different models based on their AUC scores led us to select the most effective model for our data. The use of AUC as a performance metric was especially beneficial as it is a robust measure for multi-class classification problems.
In conclusion, despite the challenges posed by high dimensionality and the failure of dimensionality reduction techniques to improve model performance, careful data preprocessing, appropriate model selection, and rigorous model evaluation were key to the successful genre classification.
